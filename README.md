# Microservices Practice App

This project is intended to help me understand the basics of Microservices and have a great
understanding of proper code workflow.

## Structure

This project is currently divided into 6 folders:

-   Client - `React side of the application`
-   Comment Service - `Backend Service for comments`
-   Post Service `Backend Service for post`
-   Event Bus - `Received events from different services and updates who ever needs that event`
-   Query - `Emit the get end point for post and comment service (Note: This service can also be used for all other get end points for other services`
-   Moderation Service - `This service will flag if the comment is approved|pending|rejected`
